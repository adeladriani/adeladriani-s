I'm a freshgraduate of Universitas Gadjah Mada, majoring in Biology. Ever since as an undergraduate student until now, I've always interested in Animal Physiology, focusing on Toxicology, Animal Reproduction, and Embriology. I have several experiences as an Intern in professional fields, such as Laboratory Assistant at Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional and Conservation Staff at Gembira Loka Zoo. Right now, I'm enrolled at Institut Teknologi Bandung for postgraduate studies in Biology.
